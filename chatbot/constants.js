  ["Step1:Take Farm soil, Vinegar, Baking Soda, Bowl, distilled Water. If done then type step2 \n\nStep2:Now Place 2 tablespoons of soil in a bowl and add ½ cup vinegar. If the mixture fizzes, you have alkaline soil.\n\n Step3: Place 2 tablespoons of soil in a bowl and moisten it with distilled water. Add ½ cup baking soda. If the mixture fizzes, you have acidic soil. \n\n After doing above step, for result we have to conclude the test, for conclusion type conclusion"],
  ["1. If it does not react to either test, the soil has a neutral pH.\n\n2. A very high or very low soil pH may result in plant nutrient deficiency or toxicity.\n\n3. A pH value of 7 is neutral, microbial activity is greatest and plant roots absorb/access nutrients best when the pH is in the 5.5 to 7 range."],
  ["The best time to check for earthworms is in the spring when the soil’s temperature has reached 50°F and its surface is moist.\n\nStep 1: Take a shovel and dig up about 1 cubic foot of soil.\n\nStep 2: Put the soil on a piece of cardboard, break it apart, and look for earthworms."],
  ["1. If your soil is healthy, you’ll find at least 10 earthworms.\n\n2. If your soil has fewer than 10 worms, add more organic matter—compost, aged manure, leaf mold. Organic matter improves structure, slowly releases nutrients, and increases beneficial microbial activity."]
