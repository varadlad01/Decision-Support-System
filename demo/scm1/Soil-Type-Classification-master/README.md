For this project a deep learning model is trained with 903 images of four different types soil. "Alluvial", "Black", "Clay" , "Red". All images are collected 
from Google Search Engine  and crafted and filtered. 

Based on the type of the Soil Crops will be suggested. Model is deployed on ![Heroku Platform](https://www.heroku.com/).
